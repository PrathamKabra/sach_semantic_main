In this project I will be trying to convert text to speech and then back to text using Python. The goal is to explore the capabilities of speech synthesis and recognition libraries.
I will be using libraries such as `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) for text-to-speech conversion and `SpeechRecognition` for speech-to-text conversion.

I have audio file from the Courtlistner Database. I would be needing that to convert it to text. The audio file is in `.wav` format, and I will use the `SpeechRecognition` library to transcribe it.
I will use the semnatic search capabilities of the `langchain` library to analyze the text generated from the audio file. and after reaching to the relevant files, I will ask the audio files as output.
